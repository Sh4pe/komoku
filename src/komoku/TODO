List of things to do:
=====================

- make this all more Go-ideomatic. Can the use of interfaces make IntList obsolete?
- make updateLegalityFor take a color parameter which specifies the color for which legality
- should be checked.
- make the usage of color more generic. A lot of 'ifs' might be removed by this. A bad example
  might be the code around line 171...
- clean up the mess between (x,y) vs. pos...
- investigate on the strange panics inside board_test...
- use anonymous fields in structs where possible
- Clean up common.go
- split the big makefile into several different ones. Restructure e/, b/ and t/ dirs...
- change Environment.CurrentGame to Environment.Game
